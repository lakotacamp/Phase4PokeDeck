# Phase4PokeDeck
This is a full stack application built with a React frontend and a flask RESTful backend that allows a user to sign in, create a team of pokemon, save it, edit it, and delete it as they please. The team builder page that allows the user to select a pokemon provides the user with the pokemon's sprite and stats which are pulled from an external API.
